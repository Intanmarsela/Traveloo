Hello Wordl! let me introduce you to Traveloo, a travel agency application. 
I had the opportunity to build this project and explore ASP .NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server.
I am using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 9.0 to develop this application.

The application is designed to be a travel agency platform where users can book trips and agents can manage their bookings.
The application has two main roles: User and Agent.

The User role allows users to view, book trips, and leave a review for the trips they have booked.
while the Agent role allows agents to upload trips, edit the uploaded trips, manage their bookings, and view/hide the reviews left by users.

If you have errors, regarding the role or database, please check the following:
1. Ensure that the database is store in ...\bin\Debug\net9.0\App_Data\Travel.mdf
2. Ensure the connection string is correct.

If you want to try the application, please follow the steps below:
1. You can register and create a new account for both user and agent. 
2. You can login with exsisted account.
